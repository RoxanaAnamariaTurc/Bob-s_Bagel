# Bob's_Bagel
 ### Main page for a bagel shop
 
 This project was done during my time at Digital Futures academy. Is a project done to assest the knowledge of HTML and CSS which we were taught in the second month of the academy.
 
 ### Technologies used
 
 * HTML
 * CSS

### Project Approach

* Build a wireframe which was a map of the bagel shop page
* Created first the HTML page and added all the tags needed for the final page to be built
* Created the CSS file separately and added style to the html elements
* Imported the CSS file into the HTML file

### Getting Started

In order to open and run this project on your local machine follow the next steps:

* Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine
* Open the folder with your favorite IDE
* Open the html file in default browser and you can see the fully built page

### Project review

* This project helped me to build on my knowledge on HTML and CSS
* Taught me to follow a series of steps to get to the final goal

### Potential next steps for the project

The next steps on this project could be building the Bagel menu, Login and Sign up pages
This project can turn into a bagel online purchase app where customers could see the bagels available and order them
